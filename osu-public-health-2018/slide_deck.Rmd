## Some thoughts on what might help with learning R

1. Interactivity in small bits
--

1. Ways to practice what you've learned
--

1. Clear documentation with examples
--

1. Use what you know to connect with the new

---

# Interactivity in small bits

- Small lessons where you can test your understanding
- Immediate (helpful) feedback on errors
- Learn by doing
- Led by practioners devoted to education
- A team of reviewers checking for course quality

--

***

Demo! `r  gif_link("https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-the-tidyverse","img/DataCamp_Horizontal_White.png", 430)`


---

# Ways to practice what you've learned

- Should be available on multiple mediums
- Short checks for knowledge growth
- Ways to apply knowledge to new situations

<!-- Over 100 courses total with another 100 currently in development -->

# Getting started with DataCamp

- Test out our free courses in [R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r), [SQL](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-sql-for-data-science), [Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science), [Git](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-git-for-data-science), and [Shell](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-shell-for-data-science)
- [DataCamp for Academics](https://www.datacamp.com/groups/education)
- [Join a community](https://www.datacamp.com/pricing) of > 2 million students of 190+ different nationalities

---

# Clear documentation with examples

<!-- One of the great perks of working at DataCamp as a Curriculum Lead is having time
to work on my own projects during what we call community time. This means that 20% of my
working hours should be spent working on interesting projects that help me interact
with the data science community. -->

- Data sets should be interesting
- Content should be written with the beginner in mind
- Materials should be modern and kept up-to-date

# Use what you know to connect with new

## Assume you understand how to create and read this

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(gapminder)
library(tidyverse)
gapminder_2007 <- gapminder %>% filter(year == 2007)
ggplot(data = gapminder_2007, 
       mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, 
                     size = pop, color = continent)) +
  geom_point()
```

---

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=7.5, fig.width=10}
library(gapminder)
library(tidyverse)
gapminder_2007 <- gapminder %>% filter(year == 2007)
ggplot(data = gapminder_2007, 
       mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, 
                     size = pop, color = continent)) +

## Extending this knowledge to something new

- How can we now learn about <u>sampling distributions</u>?

---

```{r}
library(moderndive)
bowl
```

---

## One virtual scoop of 50 balls

```{r}
set.seed(1977)
( bowl_sample <- bowl %>% sample_n(size = 50) )
```

---

# Proportion that are red

```{r}
bowl_sample %>% 
  summarize(prop_red = mean(color == "red")) %>% 
  pull()
```

--

## Is this how many are in the full bowl?

---

## Sampling variability

### What does <small>`rep_bowl_samples`</small> look like?

```{r}
library(moderndive)
rep_bowl_samples <- bowl %>% 
  rep_sample_n(size = 50, reps = 10000)
```

--

### How about <small>`bowl_props`</small>?

```{r}
bowl_props <- rep_bowl_samples %>% 
  group_by(replicate) %>% 
  summarize(prop_red = mean(color == "red"))
```


---

## The sampling distribution

```{r fig.height=4.7}
ggplot(data = bowl_props, mapping = aes(x = prop_red)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.02, color = "white")
```

---

### Shifting focus

### What about if all we had was the one sample of balls?

```{r}
bowl_sample %>% count(color)
```

--

## How could we use this sample to make a guess about the population?

---

layout: true
class: inverse

---

# Building up to statistical inference!

```{r}
library(infer)
bowl_sample %>% 
  specify(formula = color ~ NULL, success = "red")
```

---

# Bootstrapping?

```{r}
library(infer)
( bootstrap_samples <- bowl_sample %>% 
  specify(formula = color ~ NULL, success = "red") %>% 
  generate(reps = 48, type = "bootstrap") )
```

---

# What does <small>bootstrap_samples</small> represent?

## Remember we assumed that all we had was the original sample of 32 red and 18 white to start.
--

## Hope <small>bootstrap_samples</small> is close to this:

`r gif_link("http://moderndive.netlify.com/images/sampling_bowl.jpeg", "img/big_sampling_bowl.jpeg", 500)`

---

## Bootstrap statistics

```{r}
bowl_sample %>% 
  specify(formula = color ~ NULL, success = "red") %>% 
  generate(reps = 48, type = "bootstrap") %>% 
  calculate(stat = "prop")
```

---

## Do 10,000 reps to get a better sense for variability

### Just as we did with the sampling distribution

```{r}
bootstrap_stats <- bowl_sample %>% 
  specify(formula = color ~ NULL, success = "red") %>% 
  generate(reps = 10000, type = "bootstrap") %>% 
  calculate(stat = "prop")
```

---

### The bootstrap distribution

```{r fig.height=2.7, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = bootstrap_stats, mapping = aes(x = stat)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.02, color = "white") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(bootstrap_stats$stat), color = "red",
             size = 2) +
  xlim(0.15, 0.55) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = c(mean(bootstrap_stats$stat) - sd(bootstrap_stats$stat), mean(bootstrap_stats$stat) + sd(bootstrap_stats$stat)), color = "red", size = 1.5)
```

### The sampling distribution

```{r fig.height=2.7, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = bowl_props, mapping = aes(x = prop_red)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.02, color = "white") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(bowl_props$prop_red), color = "red",
             size = 2) +
  xlim(0.15, 0.55) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = c(mean(bowl_props$prop_red) - sd(bowl_props$prop_red), mean(bowl_props$prop_red) + sd(bowl_props$prop_red)), color = "red", size = 1.5)
```

## Future plans

- Generalize <small>`infer`</small> functions so it is useful to practioners as well as students
- Rewrite the inference part of the ModernDive book
- Lead more workshops on using the <small>`infer`</small> package to extend knowledge of the <small>`tidyverse`</small>, R, and statistics like [this one](https://symposium.nestat.org/short-courses.html#infer)
