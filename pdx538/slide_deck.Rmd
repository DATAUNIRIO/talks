<!-- I will discuss the motivation behind creating a data package using the data from the stories produced by FiveThirtyEight.  I’ll also walk through the process of creating a data package in R and some of the vignettes for the package that have been created by my students and others from throughout the world.  Lastly, I’ll discuss some ideas (that I’d love to work with others on) for other data packages in R that can better serve the R community by helping novice and intermediate R users work with and tidy 'messy' data. -->
